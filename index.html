      <h1>TODA – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated: [DATE]</strong></p>

      <p>
        TODA (“the App”) is a simple gratitude journaling application designed to help users reflect,
        record thoughts, and improve well-being. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy
        explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how it is protected.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        TODA does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information on external servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App may store the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gratitude entries you write</li>
        <li>Mood selections</li>
        <li>Dates and timestamps of your entries</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data remains on your phone and is <strong>never</strong> sent to any external server we control.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Photos, Images, or Media</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to attach an image or media file to an entry, it is stored locally on your device.
        We do not upload, process, or access these files on remote servers.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        The App may send optional reminder notifications (for example, daily gratitude reminders).
        Notifications are managed through a third-party service called OneSignal.
      </p>
      <p>
        OneSignal may collect anonymous device data required for delivering notifications
        (such as a push token or device identifier). We do not use this data to personally identify you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can disable notifications at any time through your device’s system settings.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        TODA uses the following third-party service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>OneSignal</strong> – used solely for sending optional push notifications.
          You can view OneSignal’s privacy policy here:
          <a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://onesignal.com/privacy
          </a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not share your written entries, mood data, or personal information with OneSignal.
        Only the minimum technical data required to deliver notifications is used.
      </p>

      <h2>5. No Account Required</h2>
      <p>
        TODA does not require you to create an account or log in. You can use the App completely
        offline, and your data stays on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is intended for general audiences and is not directed specifically at children.
        We do not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Because your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends
        on your device’s security features (such as PIN, password, or biometric lock).
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not store your data on our own servers and do not have direct access to it.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated “Last updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
